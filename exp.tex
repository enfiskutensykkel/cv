    %\item{Leading a newly established R\&D team and continuing SmartIO development and research, as well as looking into next generation PCIe and CXL.}
    \item{Turned the SmartIO framework implementation from my PhD into standard Dolphin product.}
    \item{Implemented an NVMe device driver and block device interface for Linux that makes it possible for multiple hosts in a PCIe shared-memory cluster to share and simultaneously access NVMe devices without requiring virtualization.}

\begin{experience}{Simula Research Laboratory}{
    \position{External PhD Student}{2018}{2022}
    \position{PhD Student}{2015}{2018}
}
    \item{Designed, implemented, and evaluated the SmartIO framework for distributed I/O and allowing hosts to sharing PCIe devices and disaggregate memory resources in Dolphin PCIe shared-memory clusters.}
    \item{Implemented Linux KVM hypervisor support for SmartIO using VFIO mediated device drivers, allowing remote physical devices to be assigned to VMs on different hosts in the cluster.}
    \item{Developed multiple shared-memory and RDMA-based benchmarking tools and conducted extensive evaluations to identify performance bottlenecks in Dolphin's PCIe cluster solutions, and implemented several optimizations for SmartIO that reduced latency overhead for remote memory access to near-zero (\textless 50~nanoseconds).}
    \item{Developed a CUDA/C++ library using GPUDirect and SmartIO for allowing GPUs to initiate reading and writing from NVMes directly without involving CPUs, and transferring data directly from storage into GPU memory (zero-copy).}
    \item{Published 5 academic papers based on my SmartIO work, including a paper in ACM Transactions on Computer Systems, a flagship journal on distributed computer systems.}
\end{experience}

\begin{experience}{Bridgetech}{\position{Software Developer}{2014}{2015}}
    \item{Contributed to an MPEG transport stream parser using libpcap for live capturing IPTV/MPEG-DASH traffic.}
    \item{Implemented a parser for MPEG-2 and MPEG-4/AVC video streams in order to extract and validate closed captioning data and provide real-time event notifications in case of missing or corrupted data.}
