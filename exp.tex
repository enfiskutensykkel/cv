\begin{experience}{Dolphin Interconnect Solutions}{
	\position{Software Architect}{2019}{\phantom{0000}}
    \position{Senior Software Engineer}{2018}{2019}
}
Working with Dolphin's PCIe-based shared-memory solutions. 
Gained experience with PCIe non-transparent bridging, cluster interconnects, RDMA, distributed shared-memory
architectures, NVMe, GPU programming, Linux driver development and Linux kernel hacking.

\begin{experience}{Simula Research Laboratory}{
        \position{External PhD Student}{2018}{2022}
        \position{PhD Student}{2015}{2018}
}
Was a full-time PhD student until my scholarship ran out, and then completed my PhD on my own time.
Worked on a research project in collaboration with Dolphin, with the goal of creating a framework called SmartIO for efficiently sharing I/O resources in a PCIe shared memory cluster.%
\begin{contribs}
    \item{Contributed significantly to the design and implementation of SmartIO.}
    %\item{Developed various benchmarking tools and conducted extensive evaluations to identify performance bottlenecks.}
	%\item{Developed various shared-memory cluster benchmarking tools.}
    \item{Evaluated SmartIO and identified performance bottlenecks, and implemented several optimizations that reduced the overall system performance overheads to near-zero (less than 100~nanoseconds).}
	\item{Implemented Linux KVM hypervisor support for SmartIO using VFIO mediated device drivers
		for assigning remote physical devices to VMs.}
	\item{Developed a storage framework based on SmartIO using NVMe and GPUDirect, providing
		zero-copy data transfers and allowing GPUs to initiate reads and writes directly without involving CPUs.}
    \item{Published 5 academic papers based on SmartIO, including a publication in a flagship journal on distributed computer systems (ACM TOCS).}

Worked as a back-end web developer on Fotoweb, an web-based image and video
archiving system with full-text metadata search and workflows based on
metadata tags. %
Designed REST services from the ground up, and worked with MongoDB, C++ (FastCGI) and Python (Flask). %
%Also gained some experience with MongoDB and front-end JavaScript technologies (jQuery). %

\begin{contribs}
	\item{Implemented a hierarchical metadata taxonomy tree that
		supported CRUD operations and assignment to assets of tens of thousands of metadata tags within
		milliseconds.}
	\item{Created a configurable workflow engine allowing users to
		create custom pipelines and workloads for processing assets based on
		metadata tags.}
	\item{Made a background job scheduler with support for
		webhooks and asynchronous message-passing as well as
		bulk file operations.}
	\item{Implemented both back-end and front-end for exporting
		assets to an external CMS and an access 
		management UI for these exports.}
	%\item{Contributed to migrating the existing code base from IIS to Apache.}
