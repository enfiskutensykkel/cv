    %\item{Leading a newly established R\&D team, continuing research and development of SmartIO as well as looking into next gen. PCIe and CXL.}
    \item{Responsible for turning the SmartIO framework implementation from my PhD into a standard Dolphin product.}
    \item{Implemented an NVMe device driver and block device interface on top of SmartIO, allowing multiple hosts in a PCIe cluster to share and simultaneously access NVMe devices without requiring virtualization.}

    \position{PhD Student}{2015}{2018}
}
    \item{Was a full-time PhD student until my scholarship ran out, and then completed the PhD on my own time while I worked for Dolphin.}
    \item{Designed, implemented, and evaluated the SmartIO framework for high-performance, distributed I/O by allowing hosts in a Dolphin PCIe shared-memory cluster to share PCIe devices among themselves and disaggregate memory resources.}
    \item{Implemented Linux KVM hypervisor support for SmartIO using VFIO mediated device drivers, allowing remote physical devices to be assigned to VMs on different hosts in the cluster.}
    \item{Developed multiple shared-memory and RDMA-based benchmarking tools in order to measure the performance of data transfers.}
    \item{Identified performance bottlenecks in SmartIO through extensive experimentation, and implemented several optimizations that reduced the latency overhead of remote memory access to near-zero (\textless 50~ns).}
    \item{Developed a CUDA/C++ library using GPUDirect and SmartIO that enable  GPUs to initiate reading and writing from NVMes directly, moving data from storage into GPU memory directly (zero-copy data transfer) without involving the CPU.}
    \item{Published 5 academic papers based on my SmartIO work, including a paper in a flagship journal on distributed computer systems.}
\end{experience}

\begin{experience}{Bridgetech}{\position{Software Developer}{2014}{2015}}
    \item{Contributed to an MPEG transport stream parser using libpcap for live capturing IPTV/MPEG-DASH traffic.}
    \item{Implemented a parser for MPEG-2 and MPEG-4/AVC video streams in order to extract and validate closed captioning data and provide real-time event notifications in case of missing or corrupted data.}
