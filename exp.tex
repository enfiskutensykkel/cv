	Worked on a framework for distributed high-performance IO in a PCIe cluster in
	collaboration with Dolphin Interconnect Solutions. Gained
	experience with PCIe, NTBs, high-speed interconnects, RDMA, memory
	architectures, NVMe, GPU programming, and driver development for Linux.

	\bigskip
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{Implemented hypervisor (KVM) support using VFIO mediated device drivers
			for passing through SmartIO Device Lending devices to a VM.}\\[-.6em]
		\item{Contributed to the design, development and testing of the SmartIO
			extension to the SISCI API.}\\[-.6em]
		\item{Created a library for developing distributed storage
			applications using SmartIO extension to SISCI.
			As proof of concept, I used this library in a CUDA program to demonstrate direct
			IO between GPUs and NVMe disks a cluster without
			involving CPU in the data path.}\\[-.6em]
		\item{Investigated performance issue with Intel IOMMU and
			implemented support for PCIe peer-to-peer transfers for SmartIO Device Lending.}\\[-.6em]
		\item{Developed various RDMA performance benchmarking tools.}

	Worked at a company that made hardware and software
	for real-time analysis of IPTV and OTT digital video and network
	traffic. Got experience with video encoding, PIM-SM multicasting, MPEG transport
	streams, working with C++ in an embedded environment, and
	traffic analysis.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item{Implemented a MPEG-2 and MPEG-4/AVC video stream parser for the
			VB288 content extractor using libpcap for live network
			traffic capturing.}\\[-.6em]
		\item{Made a validator for CEA608/708 closed captioning data
		embedded into MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 video streams with real-time
			error notifications.}

	\bigskip
	Worked mainly with the back-end of FotoWeb, a web-based image and video
	archiving system with full-text metadata search and workflows based on
	metadata tags. Gained experience working with WinAPI, MongoDB, web
	caches and load balancing, as well as REST services and creating HTTP endpoints with C++/FastCGI and Python/mod\_wsgi (Flask).

	\bigskip
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{Implemented a hierarchical metadata taxonomy tree that
			supported CRUD operations and assignment to assets of tens of thousands of metadata tags within
			milliseconds.}\\[-.6em]
		\item{Created a configurable workflow engine allowing users to
			create custom pipelines and workloads for processing assets based on
			metadata tags.}\\[-.6em]
		\item{Made a background job scheduler with support for
			webhooks and asynchronous message-passing as well as
			bulk file operations.}\\[-.6em]
		\item{Implemented both back-end and front-end for exporting
			assets to an external CMS and an access 
			management UI for these exports.}\\[-.6em]
		\item{Contributed to migrating the existing code base from IIS to Apache.}
