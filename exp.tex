    \position{Senior Software Engineer (R\&D)}{2018}{2019}
}
Contributed to the SmartIO framework for high-performance distributed I/O and resource sharing
in PCIe shared-memory clusters. 
Gained experience with PCIe, non-transparent bridging, cluster interconnects, RDMA, distributed shared-memory
architectures, NVMe, GPU programming, driver development and Linux kernel hacking.
\begin{contribs}
	\item{Contributed to the design, implementation and evaluation of SmartIO.}
	\item{Developed a storage framework based on SmartIO and GPUDirect, providing
		zero-copy raw block access to NVMes from multiple GPUs in the cluster without involving CPU in the data path.}
	\item{Created a distributed device driver for simultaneous sharing of a non-SR-IOV NVMe among multiple hosts in a cluster.}
	\item{Implemented Linux KVM hypervisor support using VFIO mediated device drivers
		for assigning remote physical devices to VMs (pass-through).}
	\item{Developed various shared-memory cluster benchmarking tools.}
\end{contribs}

Worked with online analysis of digital video over network.
Got experience with video encoding, PIM-SM multicasting, MPEG 
streams, working with C++ in an embedded environment, and
real-time network traffic analysis.

\begin{contribs}
	\item{Contributed to an MPEG transport stream parser for the VB288 content extractor using libpcap for live capturing
		IPTV (MPEG-DASH).}
	\item{Implemented a parser for MPEG-2 and MPEG-4/AVC video streams in order to extract and
		validate CEA608/708 closed captioning data and provide real-time event
		notifications.}

\begin{experience}[last]{Fotoware}{
	\position{Software Development Engineer (Web Back-end)}{2013}{2014}
	%\position{Front-End Developer}{2011}{2013}
}
Worked mainly with FotoWeb, a web-based image and video
archiving system with full-text metadata search and workflows based on
metadata tags. %
Designed REST services from the ground up, and worked with C++ (FastCGI) and Python (Flask). %
Also gained some experience with MongoDB and front-end technologies (JavaScript, HTML/CSS, jQuery).
%Gained experience working with Apache2, MongoDB, web
%caches, designing REST services from the ground up, and creating HTTP endpoints with C++ (FastCGI)
%and Python (Flask).

\begin{contribs}
	\item{Implemented a hierarchical metadata taxonomy tree that
		supported CRUD operations and assignment to assets of tens of thousands of metadata tags within
		milliseconds.}
	\item{Created a configurable workflow engine allowing users to
		create custom pipelines and workloads for processing assets based on
		metadata tags.}
	\item{Made a background job scheduler with support for
		webhooks and asynchronous message-passing as well as
		bulk file operations.}
	\item{Implemented both back-end and front-end for exporting
		assets to an external CMS and an access 
		management UI for these exports.}
	%\item{Contributed to migrating the existing code base from IIS to Apache.}
\end{contribs}
